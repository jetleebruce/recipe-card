This project is created as a learning. The main goal is to understand how to fetch some data from the open API. 

Component RandomMeal.js was created to get the data from open API. Visit: https://www.themealdb.com/api.php

Fist I defined the API to be ready be used by the component.

With help of useState and useEffect have fetched the data from API database

Actually I had two approaches to fetch data with useEffect. The first one is working.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
